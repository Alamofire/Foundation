## Governance

Each project maintained by the Alamofire Software Foundation
is governed by a Technical Committee (TC),
which operates under a [Consensus Seeking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus-seeking_decision-making)
decision making model.

See [GOVERNANCE.md](./GOVERNANCE.md) for details.

*We are actively working to transition projects into this new governance structure. As no formal processes existed previously for these projects, we anticipate a brief transitionary period before these policies are fully implemented. In the interim, the Alamofire Software Foundation members will serve as the TC for each project. The progress of each project's adoption of a formal Technical Committee will be tracked by [GOVERNANCE.md](./GOVERNANCE.md).*

## Code of Conduct

Our Code of Conduct governs how we behave in public or in private
whenever the project will be judged by our actions.
We expect it to be honored by everyone who represents the project
officially or informally,
claims affiliation with the project,
or participates directly.

See [CONDUCT.md](./CONDUCT.md) for details.

## Members

The Alamofire Software Foundation is represented by a board of directors, who provide logistical and financial oversight over the organization itself.

See [BYLAWS.md](./BYLAWS.md) for more details.
